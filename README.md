# Java Practice 🚀

This repository contains my **Java practice programs and mini projects**, created while learning **Core Java fundamentals** step by step.

The goal of this repo is to:
- build strong Java basics
- practice problem-solving
- understand clean project structure
- gradually move towards Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 📂 Packages Overview

### 🔹 `management`
Programs related to management systems and real-world simulations.

- **StudentManagementSystem**
    - Menu-driven console application
    - Uses arrays and control flow
    - Will be refactored later using OOP concepts

---

### 🔹 `utilities`
Programs that focus on number logic and utilities.

- **NumberUtilityProgram**
    - Prime number check
    - Palindrome check
    - Factorial calculation
    - Reverse number
    - Sum of digits

## 🧠 Concepts Covered So Far

- Java syntax & structure
- Input / Output (`Scanner`)
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Arrays & 2D arrays
- Menu-driven programs
- Package-based project organization

---

## 🔜 Future Plans

- Refactor existing programs using **OOP concepts**
- Add more mini projects:
    - Bank Management System
    - Matrix Operations
    - Library Management System
- Learn and apply:
    - Classes & Objects
    - Encapsulation
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
