# Practice Exercises 📚

This folder contains **Java practice programs** created to strengthen my understanding of **Core Java fundamentals**.

These programs are based on:
- basic problem-solving questions
- loop and condition practice
- number-based logic
- pattern printing
- series calculations

This section focuses on **logic building**, while mini projects are maintained separately.
